# Stationeers-Creative-Freedom
Break the limits of creativity!

Breaks:
Limits of construction for big and small grid objects.
Can put wires across devices and put big things in the air.
Can rotate grid things in any way.

Modified parameters:
speedup of mining drill to dig much faster
higher jetpack heightlimit

---
Can change default build state and color of construction in Creative mode.
Suit controls the construction parameters:
Pressure 50-61 for CustomColorIndex 0 (blue) - 11 (Purple).
Temperature 19-21 for CurrentBuildState -1 (destroyed) - 2 (completed frame).

---

What can bring errors: 
Please, evade suit values over max limit (not limited for now). 
Beware not to put big frame into big frame. 
Using of smart rotate from unusual angle will bring red text too.

There's also wreckage at -1 state.
