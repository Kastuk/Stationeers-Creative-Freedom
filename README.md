# Stationeers-Creative-Freedom
Break the limits of creativity!
My first attempt for hardmodding the Unity game.

Breaking limits:
* Limits of construction for big and small grid objects.
* Can put wires across devices and put big things in the air.
* Can rotate grid things in any way.

Modifying limits:
* Maximize build state of spawned structures with Authoring tool.
* Speedup of mining drill to dig much faster.
* Higher jetpack height limit.

Config for modified limits will be after game load once in
Stationeers\BepInEx\config\net.kastuk.stationeers.CreativeFreedom.cfg

What can bring errors and problems: 
---
Try not to place big frame structure into another big frame. 
Using of smart rotation at unlocked angles will bring red text too.

TODO
---
Inteface menu to config parameters and switch options.
Changeable color of spawning structures and items.
Switch mountable into small grid placement type to place buttons on tables and stuff.

More things for breaking free...
