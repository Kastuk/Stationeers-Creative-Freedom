# Stationeers-Creative-Freedom
Break the limits of creativity!

Breaks:
Limits of construction for big and small grid objects.
Can put wires across devices and put big things in the air.
Can rotate grid things in any way.

Modified parameters:
speedup of mining drill to dig much faster
higher jetpack heightlimit

---
Can change default build state and color of construction in Creative mode.
Suit controls the construction parameters:
* Pressure 50-61 for CustomColorIndex 0 (blue) - 11 (Purple).
* Temperature 19-21 for CurrentBuildState -1 (destroyed) - 2 (completed frame).

Creatively spawned items will be placed into empty hand.

---

What can bring errors and problems: 
---
Beware not to place big frame structure into another big frame. 
Using of smart rotation at unusual angle will bring red text too.

There's also trashy wreckage at -1 buildstate.

Creatively spawned items will be placed into empty hand (rovers, entities and dynamic tanks included, so it may push you away)

TODO
---
Inteface menu to config parameters and switch options.

Checks for creative mode.

More things for breaking free...
