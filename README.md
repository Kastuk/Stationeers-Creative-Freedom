# Stationeers-Creative-Freedom
Break the limits of creativity!
My first attempt for hardmodding the Unity game.

Breaking limits:
* Limits of construction for big and small grid objects.
* Can put wires across devices and put big things in the air.
* Can rotate grid things in any way.

Modifying limits:
* Maximize build state of spawned structures with Authoring tool.
* Speedup of mining drill to dig much faster.
* Higher jetpack height limit.

Config for modified limits will be here (after game load once with the mod):

**Stationeers\BepInEx\config\net.kastuk.stationeers.CreativeFreedom.cfg**

Installation
=============
1. Download last stable (I hope) release of compiled mod:
https://github.com/Kastuk/Stationeers-Creative-Freedom/releases
2. Download last stable BepInEx release:
https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
Supposedly x64 for your Windows or unix for Linux.
3. Unpack it into SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stationeers folder
4. Run Stationeers once, so BepInEx will be installed.
5. Place dll file of the mod into Stationeers\BepInEx\plugins


What can bring errors and problems: 
---
Try not to place big frame structure into another big frame. 
Using of smart rotation at unlocked angles will bring red text too.

TODO
---
*Inteface window menu or console commands for ingame config.
*Changeable color of spawning structures and items.
*Switcher key to change placement type of mountable things to small grid (to place buttons on tables and stuff).
*Lighted up the game by disabling some features (Main Menu scene and Stationpedia) to reduce memory load at slow pc.

More things for breaking free...
